There are 4 friends John, Joe, Tom and Michael.

They all like mathematics. 3 out of them thought of playing with numbers. John said that we should calculate factorial of large numbers. Joe said that we should find out the total number of divisors of a number. Tom tried to make John and Joe happy by make a question that has both factorial of large numbers and total number of divisors of a number. Tom stated that we should find factorial of a large number and count the total number of divisors of that factorial.

Michael knew that the count of divisors of a number can be very large so he suggested that final answer should be printed modulo 10^9+7.
