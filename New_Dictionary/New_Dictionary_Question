Shivani, a BBA student wants to create a new Dictionary for her Summer Project. But this Dictionary is a little different than the generic Dictionary. It has its words arranged according to the usage, such that the most used word is kept at the first and the least used word is kept at last. The quantitative usage of a word is determined by its usage-index. The higher a word's usage-index, the earlier it comes in the Dictionary. If the usage-index of a few words are same, they are to be arranged lexicographically, but with one condition. The condition is that if the initial letters of any word contains another small word (like "canteen" contains "can", "plumber" contains "plum"), the bigger word must come before the smaller word.

She want's her Dictionary to be ready as soon as possible and has a lot of work to do. She has no time to work on the arranging, and asks for your help.

#### INPUT
First line of the input will contain N (No. of Words to follow)
The next N lines will each contain a word and its usage-index seperated by a space.

#### OUTPUT
You need to print N arranged lines (each containing only the word)

#### EXAMPLE
###### INPUT
    6
    Work 2
    Workshop 2
    Library 18
    Canteen 90
    Bunk 99
    Samosa 99

###### OUTPUT
    Bunk 99
    Samosa 99
    Canteen 90
    Library 18
    Workshop 2
    Work 2

#### EXPLANATION
Primary arrangement is on the basis of Usage-Index so the sequence becomes

    Bunk, Samosa
    Canteen
    Library
    Workshop, Work

Secondary arrangment is lexicograpic, so

    Bunk
    Samosa
    Canteen
    Library
    Work
    Workshop

But according to additional condition, Workshop contains Work, so

    Bunk
    Samosa
    Canteen
    Library
    Workshop
    Work

#### CONSTRAINTS

1 <= N < 10^5

1 <= Word_Length <= 1000

1 <= Usage-Index < 10^5
